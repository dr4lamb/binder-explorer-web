# Binder Explorer

Go to, https://github.com/opersys/binder-explorer-web/releases, download both *com.opersys.otlauncher.be_0.1.apk* and _otlauncher_. The package include support for both the ARM and 32 bit x86 architectures but be conscious that running Binder Explorer in the ARM emulator will be *very* slow. We will be working on improving Binder Explorer performance later.

## How to try Binder Explorer

Install the .apk package on your device.

<pre>
$ adb install com.opersys.otlauncher.be_0.1.apk
</pre>

Copy _otlauncher_ somewhere on your device. _/data/local/tmp_ is a good idea.

<pre>
$ adb push otlauncher /data/local/tmp
</pre>

If you are using the emulator, you should forward port 3000 to your hosting computer. It might also be necessary for normal devices if you can't access the device by its IP address.

<pre>
$ adb forward tcp:3000 tcp:3000
</pre>

The next steps needs to be executed on the device as the _shell_ user. 

<pre>
$ adb shell
</pre>

Make _otlauncher_ executable: 

<pre>
root@generic_x86:/ # chmod 0755 ./otlauncher
</pre>

Execute _otlauncher_. Use the _-d_ flag to get more information about the startup.

<pre>
root@generic_x86:/ # ./otlauncher
</pre>

The Binder Explorer should then be browsable on http://localhost:3000/index.html if you forwarded ports using _adb forward_ or on your device IP, on port 3000, if you have not.
